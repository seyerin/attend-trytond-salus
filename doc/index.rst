Attendance Module
#################

The attendance module allows you to track the entry and exit time of employees.
The module also comes with a sheet that shows for each employee the total
duration per day in the company and the detail of the time of entrance and
exit.

If the timesheet module is activated it also shows the time the employee has
spent on timesheets for that day.

Period
******

Once a period is closed it is no longer possible to create, modify or delete
attendance records that are before that date.
